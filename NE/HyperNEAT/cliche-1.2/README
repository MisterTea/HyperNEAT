ABOUT:

cliche is short for "command line interface checkers". it
doesnt itself know how to play, but instead loads shared
objects, that search a given board for valid/good moves.
these modules have to conform to the API of Martin Fierz'
CheckerBoard application.


*NIX SETUP:

building the sources in this directory creates the "cliche"
executable and the "simplech", "dama" and "dummy" engine
modules.


WINDOWS SETUP:

included project files [*.dev] are for the DEV-C++ IDE.
it's available on http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html


USAGE:

the executable loads engines at runtime. engines may be
changed, without exiting the program. pass the name of an
engine, without any path and suffix, on the commandline or
enter it at the prompt. the search path is set at compile
time - edit the Makefile to change the default from
"/usr/local/share/cliche/". the current working directory is
searched too.


XCHECKERS:

to tell xcheckers you want to have cliche load the engine,
give the path to cliche and the name of the module in quotes
as a value for the engine parameter.


MANIFEST:

dama.c     - Martin's italian rules engine
simplech.c - Martin's british rules engine
dummy.c    - minimal implementation of shared object
