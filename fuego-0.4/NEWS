This file contains information about Fuego releases. It also contains a
(probably incomplete) list of the most important changes or of all
critical bugfixes in releases from a bugfix branch. For a detailed changelog
of changes in the main development branch, consult the version control
history.


Current development version
===========================

Version 0.4.1 - 2009 Dec 23
===========================

* Replaced linked list SgList and related functions by SgVector - a wrapper
  around std:vector with the same interface as SgList. Changed implementations
  that added or removed from front of list for efficiency.
* Added hooks for supporting MPI distributed memory implementations
* Add small opening book for 5x5
* Improved 9x9 opening book
* Added link to optional big 19x19 opening books at Ben Lambrechts' site
* Fixed several bugs in static safety solver
* Updated to compile with gcc 4.4.0
* Implemented SgBalancer to achieve roughly equal number of Black and White 
  moves of a specific type in playouts
* Implemented randomized use of RAVE for SelectChild
* Support for proven nodes in SgUctSearch
* Support for kgs-time_settings and different KGS overtime modes
* Refactored SgSearch, reduce size of huge functions. 
* In SgSearch::SearchEngine, use a stack instead of a vector for efficiency
* New max_memory option to uct_param_search makes Fuego easier to configure
* Implement forced opening moves in GoUctPlayer
* Set bias term constant to 0 by default on all boardsizes

Version 0.4 - 2009 May 22
=========================

* Remove SgStreamFmtRestorer; use Boost IO State Savers instead 
* Remove SgUctPriorKnowledge; Derived thread state class will supply knowledge
  values through the GenerateAllMoves() function.
* Change move count type in SgUctNode from float to size_t
* Add support for knowledge in the core of the uct tree

Version 0.3 - 2008 Dec 17
=========================

* Change some default settings to be more friendly to end users (e.g.
  automatic loading of opening book, set ignore_clock to 0)
* New parameter GoUctPlayer::ResignMinGames
* Filter moves on empty edge in GoUctDefaultRootFilter
* Added fillboard and nakade heuristic as described in recent MoGo paper
  (not enabled by default)
* reg_genmove uses now the time limit set with go_param timelimit
* Use weighted RAVE updates in SgUctSearch
* Prune nodes with low visit counts if the tree runs out of memory
* Use different counts in the prior knowledge for small and large board sizes
* New command go_sentinel_file
* Use float type for counts in SgUctNode to allow fractional counts in prior
  knowledge
* Add a locality bonus in prior knowledge (caused a big playing strength
  increase on 19x19)
* New parameter SgUctSearch::VirtualLoss
* New parameter GoUctGlobalSearchStateParam::m_lengthModification (used on
  19x19)
* Use real time as default mode for SgTime
* Don't use SgTimeControl::ReserveMoveConstant anymore
* Other improvements and fixes


Version 0.2 - 2008 Aug 28
=========================

* Declare data members of UCT nodes and signature statistis as volatile.
  This avoids that the compiler reorders writes, which could cause crashes
  if the UCT search is used in lock-free mode.
* Fix bug that caused reusing the subtree not to work (if options
  reuse_subtree or ponder were used)


Version 0.1 - 2008 May 30
=========================

Initial release. Compilation and functionality are tested on current Linux
distributions (Fedora 8, Ubuntu 8.04 LTS) and Mac OS X.
